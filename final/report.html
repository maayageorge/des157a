    <h1>˚₊‧ FINAL PROJECT CRITIQUES & REPORT ‧₊˚</h1>

    <section class="pt1">
        <p>First, Nikita Emberi critiqued my work. Her qualifications as the course TA and her design knowledge make me trust her opinion. She gave me good feedback which I will implement when designing my final project. My dad critiqued my project as well. I chose him because he has overseen numerous visual and UX/UI designers in his professional roles.</p>

        <p>Regarding the visual design of my project, I was advised to minimize unnecessary white space and eliminate scrolling. Nikita recommended relocating the help/rules button to the center for improved visibility and quicker access. Additionally, my dad suggested making the fonts and characters smaller to eliminate scrolling and making the dice pop out more by adding shadows or a background image. I was complimented on the character designs, so I think I will keep them the same.</p>
