        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>I will be updating my Game On! Project and I plan to focus on the UI/UX, visual design, and refining the functionality.</p>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>My main goal for this project is to add more visual interest to my game. Perhaps some animations for the avatars and more microinteractions with the buttons. I also want to make the buttons look cuter. Right now I don’t really like the plain white background, so I would like to change it or add some decorative background images. As for the functionality, I know there are some errors right now with certain elements. For example, when a user clicks the help button and exits it, the start button on the page disappears. The help button also doesn’t go under the overlay. I want to remove the need to scroll by making elements closer together and eliminating unnecessary space.</p>

        <h3>Expert Feedback</h3>
        <p>I will consult with the graduate student TA for code feedback and maybe one of my old design professors for visual design feedback.</p>
