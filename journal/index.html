            <h2>Entry Two - Overlay Design</h2>
            <time datetime="2023-10-23"> ✮⋆˙ October 23, 2023</time>
            <p>Overlays, also called Modals or Dialog Windows, are elements that appear above the main application window, requiring user interaction before returning to the parent application. They can be an annoyance to users, but are useful to take in user input or grab the user’s attention. It is important to design overlays well to progress task completion.</p>
            <p>According to the article "Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows" by Naema Baskanderi, overlays should be designed with an escape hatch (like a cancel button), be given a descriptive title, have clearly intentioned buttons, and should not be sized too big or too small. Darkening the background to draw focus and having the overlay be initiated by the user also improves the user interaction.</p>

            <h2>Entry One - Best practices for form design</h2>
            <time datetime="2023-10-14"> ✮⋆˙ October 14, 2023</time>
            <p>Forms are a very important (but often overlooked) element of a website. Many websites boast beautiful aesthetics, but fall short when it comes to the functionality of their forms. In the article “Best practices for form design” by Salim Ansari, he shares 20 tips for website designers to boost a form’s usability. His tips include minimizing input fields, using a one-column layout, asking the easy questions first, and utilizing placeholder text to guide users. I agree with Ansari’s tips and found them very helpful especially because I would like to know how to create well-designed forms for my own websites. Personally, I never considered that there are users who may struggle with reading text and may require accessibility controls to increase text size and display appropriate contrast for their vision. It is definitely something that I will keep in mind as I continue to design for the web.</p>
            <p>A form that I have interacted with that I think exemplifies best practices is Spotify’s questionnaire form called <a href="https://pets.byspotify.com/">Spotify Pets</a>, which asks the user questions and generates a personalized playlist for their pet based on their listening habits. I think it does an amazing job at chunking information and reducing cognitive load by displaying one question per form, engaging with the user through fun animations, and providing a progress bar to give users a clear indication of their completion status.</p>
